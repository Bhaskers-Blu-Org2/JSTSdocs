# Node.js developing in Visual Studio

Visual Studio supported developing and debugging JavaScript and TypeScript applications on Node.js without the need to install any additional components besides 
your preferred version of Node.js.

You can find everything you need to know to setup your environment, 
and start working in the [Requirements](requirements.md) section. Then you are ready to create your first
project, information about the various templates is available in the [Projects section](..\projects\nodejs.md).

In a project you can easily (work with npm packages)[npm.md], and use the 
(interactive window)[interactivewindow.md] to experiment with code.
Finally there is extensive support for various (unit test frameworks)[unittesting.md].

If you prefer to work without creating a project, Visual Studio also supports just 
[opening a folder](..\projects\openfolder.md) with code. In that scenario editing, debugging, and managing npm
packages is supported.
